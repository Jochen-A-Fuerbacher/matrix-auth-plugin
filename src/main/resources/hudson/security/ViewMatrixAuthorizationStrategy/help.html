    This mode is an extension to "Matrix-based security" that allows additional ACL matrix to be defined
    for each view separately (which is done on the view configuration screen.)

    <p>
    This allows you to say things like "Joe can access view A, B, and C but he can't see D."
    See the help of "Matrix-based security" for the concept of matrix-based security in general.

    <p>
    ACLs are additive, so the access rights granted below will be effective for all the view.
